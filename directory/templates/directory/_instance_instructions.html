				Honestly, this probably should not be allowed, but since we can't
				set a default GPG key in the database, since it's a file, I've
				accounted for the possibility that one isn't set at least for dev
				environments.

			This could be evidence of an attempted attack, or it could be a simple
			failure to communicate between an organization running SecureDrop and
			Freedom of the Press Foundation.
			In either case, we will investigate the matter and establish a path to
			resolution.
